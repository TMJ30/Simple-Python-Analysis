# PyBank PyPoll Analysis

**PyBank:** Created a Python script to analyze financial records of a sample company named PyBank using the financial dataset provided in the [budget data](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv) CSV file.

The script explores the company's financial performance over time and calculates:
* Total number of months in the datset
* The total net smount of **Profit/Losses** over the entire period
* The month-to-month changes in **Profit/Losses** and average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (with date and amount)
* The greatest decrease in profits (with date and amount)





Used the concepts learned to complete two Python csv challenges: PyBank and PyPoll



**PyBank**:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote
